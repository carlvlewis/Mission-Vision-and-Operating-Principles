# Vision
 *The world as weâ€™d like to see it*

**What if we built a government that worked for the American people in the 21st century?**

Where services are simple, beautiful, and easy to use.

Where outcomes are measurably better.

Where better costs less.

Where we serve everyone equally with dignity.

It would be the biggest source of societal good for a generation.

We must all build it together.

# Mission
*How we intend to make our vision real*

Code for America uses the principles and practices of the digital age to improve how government serves the American public, and how the public improves government.

1. **To inspire change**
To inspire change To inspire public servants, people from the technology sector, and community organizers to create change by demonstrating that government services can be simple, beautiful, and easy to use.

2. **To make change real**
Providing government with access to the resources and digital talent they need so that together we can meaningfully impact some of the world's toughest societal challenges.

3. **To make change stick**
Connecting and convening people from inside and outside government, and from all over the world to inspire each other, share successes, learn, build, and shape a new culture of public service for the 21st century.

**To do it all at scale, serving those who need it most.**

# Outcomes
*How do we know if we're getting it right?*

* **Fewer people go hungry** by closing the SNAP participation gap
* **Fewer people go to jail** by safely reducing unnecessary incarceration
* **More people get work** by increasing employment among those who are the hardest to employ
* Government will employ different kinds of talent
* We'll see a new category of civic technology consulting emerge
* Government RFPs will transform in their asks
* The civic tech movement will be dynamic and evolving

# Our values
*what we are like as an organization*

1. **Empathy is our operating system.** We have a deep empathy for the people we work with. We seek to understand the problems they have, we put ourselves in their shoes, and we work tirelessly to serve them.
2. **No one is coming. It's up to us.** We don't wait to be asked; we act. We don't ask for permission; we find a way. We don't talk change; we deliver it.
3. **Build the movement; cultivate the karass.** No one organization can fulfill this vision; we will succeed through a movement that invites everyone to roll up their sleeves and do their part.

# Our operating principles
*The ideas that guide the decisions we make*

* **Solve real problems.** We solve problems that real people have, we make sure what we build works for them, and we continuously improve it. We solve real problems instead of just creating elegant code and robust systems to solve imagined ones.
* **Work with, not for** the people we serve. We respect our users by actively including them in the process of design and delivery. We respect and support public servants, and when we are critical of government outcomes, we blame the system, not the people.* 
* **Start and end with the user**
Start by understanding the needs of the people government serves. Work with real people to understand who they are, what they need, and how they behave throughout the process.
* **Move fast, iterate quickly**
Get a working minimum viable product (MVP) in front of users as early as possible and make continuous improvements based on how they use the service.
* **Make it better with data**
Inform iterations with data about user behavior. Evaluate programs based on data about outcomes.

*Laurenellen McCann first spoke about building with, not for at the 2014 Code for America Summit.
